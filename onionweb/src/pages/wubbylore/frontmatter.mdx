## "wat this"

This is a *fan-made* wubby lore that I, **Onion** made just solely out of fun and boredom.

## "hey wasnt there another wubby lore boo-"

Yes, yes there was, and its actually the inspiration for this book! Here is the link: [Click me!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S0TJZv8ZzbojY79JYHGHYo8BmsMcicR0agFsCQ76VRY/edit?usp=sharing)\
(i think there was another version of the wubble but i lost the link) (also credits to purpledoctor (in the wubby server) for creating the wubble)

## "is this wubby history"
No, it is a fictional lore about the game Wubby, it has little to no ties to the actual history of the game.\
For the actual history, the closest thing is the [changelog](https://wubbypedia.miraheze.org/wiki/Changelog).
